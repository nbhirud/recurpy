# recurpy
Project for planning the days ahead. To start with, the goal is to track recurring things that need to be done on a daily or weekly or monthly or yearly basis like paying rent, going to gym, cleaning the house, etc. Later on, I would like to add more features, and not restrict it to habits or to do list type thing.
